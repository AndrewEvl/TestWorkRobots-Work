#####Specification

The start page of my application is the [home page](http://localhost:8080/home). 
When I go to this page, the application will start working.
In order to suspend the application and see its current status, 
click on this link [stop application](http://localhost:8080/home/stop). 
There are also [pages](http://localhost:8080/add-robots) for manually 
creating a robot and manually creating works for its execution.
Also, you can manually create a work for [robots](http://localhost:8080/add-work). 
At startup, the application automatically creates work for robots, 
as well as sending robots to work and if the robots are missing, 
the application creates new ones for its execution. 
All information is displayed on the start page in real time.

***Haw a nice day!***
