Specification

The start page of my application is the home page <http://localhost:8080/home>. 
When you go to this page, the application will start work.
In order to suspend the application and see its current status, 
click on this link stop application <http://localhost:8080/home/stop>. 
There is also page <http://localhost:8080/add-robots> for manually 
creation of robot and manually creation of works for its execution.
Also, you can manually create work for robots <http://localhost:8080/add-work>. 
At startup, the application automatically creates work for robots, 
as well as sending robots to work. If the robots are missed, 
the application will creates new ones for its execution. 
All information is displayed dynamically at the start page.
